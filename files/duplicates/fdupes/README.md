## Description

This is a command line tool to find duplicate files. For example, if you regularly make a full backup of your files and need to go back and review for duplicates across multiple backups. This is the tool to use. Highly flexible so you're not spending hours clicking confirmations and still have full control over what will be removed and kept. As well as confidence you're not nuking important files.

## Install

```bash
brew install fdupes

# windows (WSL)
sudo apt install -y fdupes # can be older version b/c debian

# windows jdupes (TODO test this)
choco install jdupes # fork of fdupes

```
